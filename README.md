#  Car Price Analysis Using Regression
This project code is designed for car price analysis using regression techniques. It encompasses several essential steps, including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the code's functionality:

#Overview
Importing Libraries
The code begins by importing essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and scikit-learn. These libraries are utilized for data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Function Definitions
The code defines several functions to facilitate the analysis:

DistributionPlot: This function creates distribution plots (kernel density estimates) to compare two datasets.
plots: It generates Seaborn box plots and scatter plots for data visualization.
pearsoncorelation: This function calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient and associated p-value between two variables and displays the results.
Loading and Preprocessing Data
The code loads a dataset from a CSV file and conducts preliminary data preprocessing. Key preprocessing steps include:

Replacing missing values (marked as '?') with zeros.
Scaling numeric features via Min-Max scaling.
Handling zero values in the "price" column by replacing them with the mean and applying a scaling factor (80 in this instance).
Encoding categorical variables using label encoding.
Data Preparation
Data Splitting
The dataset is partitioned into training and testing sets utilizing scikit-learn's train_test_split function.

Polynomial Feature Transformation
The code engineers polynomial features from the input variables employing scikit-learn's PolynomialFeatures. This feature engineering technique captures more complex relationships within the data.

Model Training and Evaluation
Ridge Regression Model
A Ridge regression model is trained on the transformed data. Ridge regression is a variant of linear regression that incorporates regularization to mitigate overfitting.

Model Evaluation
The code assesses the Ridge regression model by computing various metrics and visualizations, including:

Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values for numeric features, with the results plotted.
Mean coefficients and the model's intercept.
R-squared value (a measure of model performance).
Cross-validation scores and predictions.
Visualizations
Distribution Plot
The project culminates with a distribution plot that visually compares actual car prices with predicted values generated by the model.

Please note that the code assumes proper data formatting and the presence of all required dependencies for successful execution.
