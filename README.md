# Car Price Analysis Using Regression

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Car Price Analysis Using Regression" project! This comprehensive tool has been crafted to empower car traders and enthusiasts with valuable insights into pricing vehicles based on their unique attributes. Whether you're a seasoned car dealer or a passionate automotive enthusiast, this code can assist you in making informed pricing decisions.

### The Pricing Challenge

Setting the right price for a car can be a complex and crucial task. Overpricing might deter potential buyers, while underpricing can lead to financial losses. Achieving that perfect balance between profitability and market competitiveness is where this project shines. It employs regression techniques to predict car prices, taking into account a wide range of features and characteristics.

## Key Functionalities

Let's dive into the core functionalities of this project:

### 1. Importing Libraries

To start, we import a suite of powerful Python libraries that serve as the backbone of this analysis. Among these are:

- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **SciPy** for statistical analysis.
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning operations.

These libraries collectively enable us to handle data effectively, visualize trends, perform statistical tests, and build predictive models.

### 2. Function Definitions

The project incorporates custom functions to enhance the analysis process:

- **DistributionPlot**: This function generates distribution plots, specifically kernel density estimates, to provide a visual representation of data distributions.
- **plots**: It offers the ability to create Seaborn box plots and scatter plots for comprehensive data visualization.
- **pearsoncorelation**: To understand relationships between variables, this function calculates Pearson correlation coefficients and their associated p-values.

### 3. Loading and Preprocessing Data

The journey begins by loading a dataset containing a wealth of car-related information from a CSV file. Before diving into the analysis, we conduct crucial data preprocessing steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing data marked as '?' is replaced with zeros to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
- **Scaling Numeric Features**: We apply Min-Max scaling to numeric features, bringing them into a uniform range to prevent one feature from dominating the analysis.
- **Price Standardization**: The "price" column is carefully adjusted. Zero values are replaced with the mean, and all prices are scaled by a factor (in this case, 80) for consistent representation.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded using label encoding, transforming textual data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Data Preparation

### Data Splitting

Before diving into modeling, the dataset is strategically split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. This division ensures an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.

### Polynomial Feature Transformation

To capture intricate relationships between features, we employ the power of polynomial features. Using scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures` module, we engineer polynomial features from the input variables, allowing the model to grasp non-linear patterns.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Ridge Regression Model

For the heart of our predictive analysis, we turn to the Ridge regression model. Why Ridge? Because it excels at handling multicollinearity among features and prevents overfitting by incorporating a regularization term in the cost function. This ensures a more stable and reliable model for price prediction.

### Model Evaluation

The Ridge regression model undergoes a rigorous evaluation process:

- **Pearson Correlation Coefficients**: For numeric features, we calculate Pearson correlation coefficients and their corresponding p-values. This helps us understand the strength and significance of relationships with the target variable.
- **Model Coefficients and Intercept**: We explore the mean coefficients and the model's intercept, shedding light on the factors that drive car price predictions.
- **R-squared Value**: An essential metric, the R-squared value, is computed to gauge how well the model explains the variance in car prices. A high R-squared value indicates a more accurate model.
- **Cross-Validation Scores and Predictions**: To ensure the model's robustness, we perform cross-validation and generate predictions. This step helps us ascertain the model's generalizability and its ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data.

## Visualizations

### Distribution Plot

To wrap up our analysis, we present a visually striking distribution plot. This plot provides an intuitive comparison between actual car prices and the predictions generated by our model. By observing the alignment between the two, you can assess the model's accuracy and gain insights into how it can influence your pricing decisions.
